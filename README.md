# PonyFaces

A sample app using the [ponyfac.es](ponyfac.es) API to search the ponyfac.es catalog of My Little Pony face images, and maintain a list of favorites.

# Third Party Dependencies

Third party dependencies are managed using CocoaPods. All CocoaPod sources have been checked in to the repository and the app can be built without running CocoaPods.

# Building
